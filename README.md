# Speech-Recognized-Music-Player
A personal project I developed, using Python that allows users to play music offline using voice commands. The project uses pyAudio to capture audio input from the microphone, speech_recognition to convert the audio to text, and gtts (Google Text To Speech) to provide feedback to the user.
